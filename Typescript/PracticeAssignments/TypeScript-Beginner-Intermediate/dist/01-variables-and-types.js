/* Create variables using let, const, and var to store a user's profile information including their name (string), age (number),
isActive (boolean), and accountBalance (number). Practice reassigning values where appropriate and observe the differences
between let, const, and var scoping. Try to reassign a const variable to see the error, and create variables inside different
scopes (like if statements or functions) to understand how let and var behave differently. Also experiment with type
inference by not explicitly declaring types and see how TypeScript automatically infers them. */
